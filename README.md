# GsConnectionManager
This project is a Gesture Suite plug in that helps Gesture Suite change the wifi state for devices running Android 10 and above and the state of bluetooth for devices running Android 13 and above

Google has restricted developers to only upload apps that target Android 13 and above. At the same time Google blocked apps that target Android 10 and above from changing the wifi state and apps that target earlier than Android 13 from changing the bluetooth state. That is why it's not possible for Gesture Suite to change the wifi state on its own. 


GsConnectionManager is able to change the wifi and bluetooth state because it's targeting Android Pie. For that reason it is not allowed to be published on Google Play Store. The code is freely available for everyone to inspect and confirm that the app does nothing more than changing the wifi/bluetooth state.

Steps to install:

1. Download the GsConnectionManager_1.0.apk file that is at the root of the repository. You can use the link https://github.com/Whiteboxk/GsConnectionManager/raw/master/GsConnectionManager_1.0.apk
2. Open the downloaded file.
3. Allow installation.

You may be asked to enable installing unknown sources for the app you used to open the apk file.
